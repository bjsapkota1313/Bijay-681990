                        Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, is set in a valley surrounded by the Himalayan mountains. At the heart of the old city’s mazelike alleys is Durbar Square, which becomes frenetic during Indra Jatra, a religious festival featuring masked dances. Many of the city's historic sites were damaged or destroyed by a 2015 earthquake. Durbar Square's palace, Hanuman Dhoka, and Kasthamandap, a wooden Hindu temple, are being rebuilt. 
                        The city of Kathmandu is named after a structure in Durbar Square called Kaasthamandap. In Sanskrit, Kaasth (काष्ठ) is "wood" and Mandap (मंडप/मण्डप) is "covered shelter." This unique temple, also known as Maru Sattal, was built in 1596 C.E. by King Laxmi Narsingh Malla. This two-story pagoda contains no iron nails or supports and is made entirely from wood, believed to be obtained from a single tree.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu" target="blank"> For More information</a>

                        Pokhara Valley is the second-largest valley in the hilly region of Nepal. It lies in the western part of Nepal. The cities of Pokhara and Lekhnath are in the valley. It is located in Gandaki zone, 203 kilometres (126 mi) west of Kathmandu Valley.[1] The city of Pokhara is one of the major cities of Nepal and it, like Kathmandu Valley, is extremely vulnerable to earthquakes due to its clay soil and liquefaction potential.
                        Annapurna Base Camp trekking, also known as ABC trekking, is another main attraction of Pokhara Valley. Trekking starts from Pokhara following Nayapul, Ghorepani, Tadapani, Sinuwa, Deurali and finally to Annapurna Base Camp which is at the height of 4090 m (13,418 ft). Many hotels and lodges are available throughout the journey. Visitors can enjoy the beautiful scenes of forests, hills, rhododendron (national flower), and many villages along the way. One study shows that ABC attracts about 25,000 visitors on the short trekking season, which is almost five times greater than Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest) 
                            National Park, which is the second most popular trekking destination of Nepal. ABC trekking has played a vital role in the economic status of people around this area, as well as, it is a milestone for the development of tourism industry in Nepal. <a href="https://indiahikes.com/annapurna-base-camp/#gref" target="blank">For planning to Trek</a>

                        Mustang, the second least populated district of Nepal, is flanked by the Nepalese districts of Manang, the least populated, to the east and Dolpa, the third least populated, to the west. The Tibetan frontier stretches north from Mustang's borders. Mustang is divided into two sub-regions, Lower and Upper. This is a high-altitude trans-Himalayan region spread over 3,640 square kilometres in area barely north of the main Himalayan mountain range. Geographically this cold high-altitude steppe is a part of the Tibetan highlands.This boot-shaped piece of land thrusts north into western Tibet is caught in the rain shadow of Dhaulagiri to the south and west and the Annapurna Massif to the north and east.
                            Average elevation of Mustang is 13,200 ft (2,500m), coming to a peak at 8,167m — the summit of Dhaulagiri. It is a vast and arid valley, distinguished by eroded canyons, vividly coloured stratified rock formations and barren high-altitude deserts. The area receives an average annual rainfall of less than 260 mm at Jomsom in the Lower Mustang. Spring and autumn are generally dry, but some precipitation is brought by summer monsoons, which averaged 133 mm at Jomsom between 1973 and 2000. The mean minimum monthly air temperature falls to -2.7 °C in winter while the maximum monthly air temperature reaches 23.1 °C in summer. Both diurnal and annual variations in temperature are large. Only about 40.3 square kilometers, about 1 percent of the total land area, is cultivated and 1,477 square kilometers, about 40%, is pasture land.[10] Kora La at 4,660 metres (15,290 ft) in elevation is considered the lowest drivable path between Tibetan Plateau and Indian subcontinent. <a href="https://www.thirdrockadventures.com/trip-enquiry">Wanna Trek? </a>
